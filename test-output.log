I’ve seen the elite implementation of all three in working with professional athletes. In this post, we’ll explore what I refer to as the “slow-carb diet”.\n\nIn the last six weeks, I have cut from about 180 lbs. to 165 lbs., while adding about 10 lbs. of muscle, which means I’ve lost about 25 lbs. of fat. This is the only diet besides the rather extreme [Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170807102316/http://www.bodybuildingdungeon.com/forums/nutrition/2156-cdk-cyclical.html) that has produced veins across my abdomen, which is the last place I lose fat (damn you, Scandinavian genetics). Here are the four simple rules I followed…\n\n**Rule #1: Avoid “white” carbohydrates**\n\nAvoid any carbohydrate that is — or can be — white. The following foods are thus prohibited, except for within 1.5 hours of finishing a resistance-training workout of at least 20 minutes in length: bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried food with breading. If you avoid eating anything white, you’ll be safe.\n\n**Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again**\n\nThe most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. Mix and match, constructing each meal with one from each of the three following groups:\n\n**Proteins:**\n\nEgg whites with one whole egg for flavor\n\nChicken breast or thigh\n\nGrass-fed organic beef\n\nPork\n\n**Legumes:**\n\nLentils\n\nBlack beans\n\nPinto beans\n\n**Vegetables:**\n\nSpinach\n\nAsparagus\n\nPeas\n\nMixed vegetables\n\nEat as much as you like of the above food items. Just remember: keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries or potatoes. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food, swapping out rice for vegetables, to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the “slow carb” diet.\n\nMost people who go on “low” carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit, not because such diets can’t work, but because they consume insufficient calories. A 1/2 cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a 1/2 cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load.\n\nSome athletes eat 6-8x per day to break up caloric load and avoid fat gain. I think this is ridiculously inconvenient. I eat 4x per day:\n\n10am – breakfast\n\n1pm – lunch\n\n5pm – smaller second lunch\n\n7:30-9pm – sports training\n\n10pm – dinner\n\n12am – glass of wine and Discovery Channel before bed\n\nHere are some of my meals that recur again and again:\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/breakfast-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nScrambled [Eggology pourable egg whites](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/eggology-organic-liquid-egg-whites-6591f9) with one whole egg, black beans, and microwaved mixed vegetables\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/lunch-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and extra guacamole (Mexican restaurant)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dinner-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef (from Trader Joe’s), lentils, and mixed vegetables\n\n**Rule #3: Don’t drink calories**\n\nDrink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened iced tea, tea, diet sodas, coffee (without white cream), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk, normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. I’m a wine fanatic and have at least one glass of wine each evening, which I believe actually aids sports recovery and fat-loss. Recent research into resveratrol supports this.\n\n**Rule #4: Take one day off per week**\n\nI recommend Saturdays as your “Dieters Gone Wild” day. I am allowed to eat whatever I want on Saturdays, and I go out of my way to eat ice cream, Snickers, Take 5, and all of my other vices in excess. I make myself a little sick and don’t want to look at any of it for the rest of the week. Paradoxically, dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function, etc.) doesn’t downregulate from extended caloric restriction. That’s right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat. Welcome to Utopia.\n\n###\n\n**If you enjoyed this post, check out my latest book, [_The 4-Hour Body_](http://amzn.to/snZqtO), #1 New York Times and #1 Amazon bestseller.** You will learn: the finer details of the Slow Carb Diet (outlined in the above post), how I gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, how to produce 15-minute female orgasms, and more.\n\n**You can also get the [Expanded and Updated 4-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357?ie=UTF8&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASI","description":"This post is one of Tim Ferriss’s most-read and referenced articles, introducing the Slow-Carb Diet and practical fat loss strategies that became foundational to his health philosophy.","topic":"Fitness & Health","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:05.574Z","source":"perplexity-popular"},{"url":"https://tim.blog/2013/05/06/how-to-cut-weight-ufc/","title":"How To Lose 20-30 Pounds In 5 Days: The Extreme Weight Cutting and Rehydration Secrets of UFC Fighters","content":"![Nate Green workout and nutrition tests collage showing feet on a scale, dietician's hand on his stomach, vertical jump test using ladder rungs, chest circumference measurement with tape.](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/measuring-main-photo.jpg?resize=500%2C361&ssl=1)\n\nThe following is a guest post by [Nate Green](https://nategreen.org/about/), who works with Dr. John Berardi, nutritional advisor to athletes like UFC champion Georges St. Pierre (GSP).\n\nThis is the first of two blog posts entailing extreme physical experiments. Absolutely no performance enhancing drugs of any kind were used.\n\n**Part 1 — this post — details exactly how top fighters like Georges St. Pierre rapidly lose 20-30 pounds for “weigh-ins.”** To refine the method, Nate performed this on himself, losing 20 pounds in 5 days. The unique part: Dr. Berardi and team measured key variables throughout the entire process, including the last “rehydration” phase. As Berardi put it:\n\n> “We used GSP’s exact protocol with him \\[Nate\\]. The idea was that by doing this with a guy who didn’t actually have to compete the next day, we could measure all sorts of performance variables that you’d never get with an athlete about to fight.”\n\n**Part 2 — [the next post](https://tim.blog/2013/05/11/how-to-gain-20-pounds-in-28-days-the-extreme-muscle-building-secrets-of-ufc-fighters/) — will share how Nate used intermittent fasting and strategically planned eating to gain 20 pounds in 28 days**, emulating a fighter who wants (or needs) to move up a weight class in competition.\n\n### Cautionary Note on Part 1\n\nMixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters put it all out in the open for the world to see: they kick, punch, laugh, cry, and bleed in front of thousands of arena fans and millions more watching at home.\n\nBut even if you’re a hardcore fan who knows all the stats, there’s something behind the scenes that you’ve probably never seen in full: **world-class weight manipulation**…\n\nDone right, it can significantly increase a fighter’s chances of winning. An athlete will artificially lower his weight for pre-fight weigh-ins, then show up to the actual fight 10, 20, or even 30 pounds heavier than his opponent. It’s a game changer.\n\nDone wrong, it can make even the toughest guy lose his edge… and probably the fight. There’s serious risk of organ failure if done haphazardly.\n\nEven though boxers and wrestlers have been manipulating weight in this fashion for decades, it has the air of illicit activity. **And though it’s legal in MMA competition, you should _never_ try this at home or without medical supervision. Excessive dehydration can kill you. “Cutting weight” has no place in real-world dieting or behavior.**\n\nThis is NOT an article on sustainable weight loss or healthy living. Rather, it’s a fascinating look at how far athletes and scientists will go to manipulate the human body for competitive advantage.\n\nHere’s how it works…\n\n### Enter Nate\n\nImagine this: It’s Saturday night and you’re a top-ranked MMA fighter who just stepped into the cage to fight for the 170-pound Welterweight Championship.\n\n**Question:** How much do you weigh?\n\nThe answer may seem obvious: 170 pounds, right? But if you followed the steps of extreme weight manipulation, the real answer is that you weigh somewhere between 185 and 190 pounds. That’s 15-20 pounds _more_ than the “cutoff” weight of 170.\n\n24 hours _before_ you stepped into the cage, however, you did in fact weigh 170 pounds. You had to. Friday night was the official weigh-in where you and your opponent both stripped down to your skivvies, stepped on the scale in front of the judge, and prayed that the number on the scale hit 170 or lower.\n\nBut once you stepped off that scale it was a race to gain weight.\n\nI find this kind of physiological puppetry very interesting. Most of us regular guys have a hard time gaining or losing just 5 pounds at a time.\n\nBut the top combat athletes can lose up to 30 pounds in just _5 days_ leading up to the fight. Then they can gain nearly all of it back in the 24 hours between weighing in and going toe-to-toe.\n\nThey do this to gain a massive competitive advantage. In other words, the bigger guy who retains more of his strength, agility, and endurance will likely win. The guy who weighs in at 170 — and then _fights_ at 170 — often has a world of hurt coming his way.\n\nThat’s why Anderson Silva – arguably the world’s best MMA fighter — normally fights in the 185-pound class even though he actually weighs 215 pounds. A few days before he fights, Anderson “cuts” 30 pounds to make weight…then gains most of his weight back in 24 hours in time for his fight.\n\nGeorges St Pierre — arguably the world’s 2nd best fighter – normally walks around at 195 pounds. He ends up cutting 25 pounds to make his 170 pound weight class, and then gains 20 of it back before his fight.\n\nSneaky, huh?\n\nJust how do these guys do it? And what does this rapid weight loss and weight gain do to their performance?\n\n### My Ext","description":"A widely shared deep dive into rapid weight loss techniques used by professional fighters, offering actionable and controversial insights into extreme body transformation.","topic":"Fitness & Health","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:22.819Z","source":"perplexity-popular"},{"url":"https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/","title":"Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes","content":"How much more could you get done if you completed all of your required reading in 1/3 or 1/5 the time?\n\nIncreasing reading speed is a process of controlling fine motor movement—period.\n\nThis post is a condensed overview of principles I taught to undergraduates at Princeton University in 1998 at a seminar called the “PX Project.” The below was written several years ago, so it’s worded like Ivy Leaguer pompous-ass prose, but the results are substantial. In fact, while on an airplane in China two weeks ago, I helped [Glenn McElhose](http://www.dirtsalad.com/) increase his reading speed 34% in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI have never seen the method fail. Here’s how it works…\n\n### The PX Project\n\nThe PX Project, a single 3-hour cognitive experiment, produced an average increase in reading speed of 386%.\n\nIt was tested with speakers of five languages, and even dyslexics were conditioned to read technical material at more than 3,000 words-per-minute (wpm), or 10 pages per minute. One page every 6 seconds. By comparison, the average reading speed in the US is 200-300 wpm (1/2 to 1 page per minute), with the top 1% of the population reading over 400 wpm…\n\nIf you understand several basic principles of the human visual system, you can eliminate inefficiencies and increase speed while improving retention.\n\nTo perform the exercises in this post and see the results, you will need: a book of 200+ pages that can lie flat when open, a pen, and a timer (a stop watch with alarm or kitchen timer is ideal). You should complete the 20 minutes of exercises in one session.\n\n**First, several definitions and distinctions specific to the reading process:**\n\n**A) Synopsis:** **You must minimize the number and duration of fixations per line to increase speed.**\n\nYou do not read in a straight line, but rather in a sequence of saccadic movements (jumps). Each of these saccades ends with a fixation, or a temporary snapshot of the text within you focus area (approx. the size of a quarter at 8 inches from reading surface). Each fixation will last ¼ to ½ seconds in the untrained subject. To demonstrate this, close one eye, place a fingertip on top of that eyelid, and then slowly scan a straight horizontal line with your other eye-you will feel distinct and separate movements and periods of fixation.\n\n**B) Synopsis:** **You must eliminate regression and back-skipping to increase speed.**\n\nThe untrained subject engages in regression (conscious rereading) and back-skipping (subconscious rereading via misplacement of fixation) for up to 30% of total reading time.\n\n**C) Synopsis:** **You must use conditioning drills to increase horizontal peripheral vision span and the number of words registered per fixation.**\n\nUntrained subjects use central focus but not horizontal peripheral vision span during reading, foregoing up to 50% of their words per fixation (the number of words that can be perceived and “read” in each fixation).\n\n### The Protocol\n\nYou will 1) learn technique, 2) learn to apply techniques with speed through conditioning, then 3) learn to test yourself with reading for comprehension.\n\nThese are separate, and your adaptation to the sequencing depends on keeping them separate. Do not worry about comprehension if you are learning to apply a motor skill with speed, for example. The adaptive sequence is: technique ‘ technique with speed ‘ comprehensive reading testing.\n\nAs a general rule, you will need to practice technique at 3x the speed of your ultimate target reading speed. Thus, if you currently read at 300 wpm and your target reading speed is 900 wpm, you will need to practice technique at 2,700 words-per-minute, or 6 pages per minute (10 seconds per page).\n\nWe will cover two main techniques in this introduction:\n\n1) Trackers and Pacers (to address A and B above)\n\n2) Perceptual Expansion (to address C)\n\n### First – Determining Baseline\n\nTo determine your current reading speed, take your practice book (which should lay flat when open on a table) and count the number of words in 5 lines. Divide this number of words by 5, and you have your average number of words-per-line.\n\nExample: 62 words/5 lines = 12.4, which you round to 12 words-per-line\n\nNext, count the number of text lines on 5 pages and divide by 5 to arrive at the average number of lines per page. Multiply this by average number of words-per-line, and you have your average number of words per page.\n\nExample: 154 lines/5 pages = 30.8, rounded to 31 lines per page x 12 words-per-line = 372 words per page\n\nMark your first line and read with a timer for 1 minute exactly-do not read faster than normal, and read for comprehension. After exactly one minute, multiply the number of lines by your average words-per-line to determine your current words-per-minute (wpm) rate.\n\n### Second – Trackers and Pacers\n\nRegression, back-skipping, and the duration of fixations can be minimized by using a tracker and pacer.

This quote convinced me to put on my big girl pants:\n\n> “The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right.”\n>\n> – Neil Gaiman\n>\n> [University of the Arts Commencement Speech](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/05/22/neil-gaiman-commencement-speech/)\n\nSo, here goes, and I hope it helps at least a few of you.\n\n### Reality Check\n\nA few months ago, I had a birthday party.\n\nA dozen friends and I gathered for several days of wonderful sun, beach, and catching up. On the last day, I didn’t get up until 11:30am, knowing full well that the last remaining friends were leaving at 12 noon.\n\nI was afraid of being alone.\n\nLike a child, I hid my head under the covers (literally) and hit snooze until reality couldn’t be postponed any further.\n\nBut…why am I telling you this?…\n\n### The Dangerous Myths of “Successful” People\n\nWe all like to appear “successful” (a nebulous term at best) and the media like to portray standouts as superheroes.\n\nSometimes, these dramatic stories of overcoming the odds are inspiring. More often, they lead to an unhealthy knee-jerk conclusion:\n\n**“Well… maybe _they_ \\[entrepreneur/artist/creator painted as superhero\\] can do it, but I’m just a normal guy/girl…”**\n\nThis post is intended to give a behind-the-scenes look at my own life. Though I’ve occasionally done profiles like [A Day In The Life](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/04/24/tim-ferriss-a-day-in-the-life/) with Morgan Spurlock’s crew, I rarely let journalists follow me for a “normal” day. Why?\n\nI’m no superhero. I’m not even a consistent “normal.”\n\n**In the last 3 months, I’ve:**\n\n- Cried while watching [Rudy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W221/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004W221&linkCode=as2&tag=offsitoftimfe-20).\n- Repeatedly hit Snooze for 1-3 HOURS past my planned wake time, because I simply didn’t want to face the day.\n- Considered giving everything away and moving to Montreal, Seville, or Iceland. Location varies based on what I’m escaping.\n- Seen a therapist for the first time, as I was convinced that I was doomed to life-long pessimism.\n- Used gentlemanly (ahem) websites to “relax” during the day when I clearly have urgent and important shit to do. [1](https://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/#fn-10297-1)\n- Taken my daily caffeine intake (read: self-medication) so high that my “resting” pulse was 120+ beats per minute. 8-10 cups of coffee per day minimum.\n- Worn the same pair of jeans for a week straight just to have a much-needed constant during weeks of chaos.\n\nSeems pretty dysfunctional, right?\n\n**But, in the last 8 weeks, I’ve also:**\n\n- Increased my passive income 20%+.\n- Bought my dream house.\n- Meditated twice per day for 20 minutes per session, without fail. This marks the first time I’ve been able to meditate consistently.\n- I’ve cut my caffeine intake to next-to-nothing (in the last 4 weeks): usually pu-erh tea in the morning and green tea in the afternoon. I’ve had no more than 1 cup of coffee per week. More on this in a later post.\n- With your help, [raised $100,000+ for charity:water](http://my.charitywater.org/timferriss) for my birthday. (Thanks to John Park for bringing the thunder!)\n- [Raised $250,000 in 53 minutes for a start-up called Shyp](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/09/23/youd-like-to-be-an-angel-investor-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-my-deals/).\n- Signed [one of the most exciting business deals of my last 10 years](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/10/13/the-tim-ferriss-experiment/).\n- Added roughy 20 pounds of muscle after learning the pain and joy of high-rep front squats (and topical DHEA, courtesy of Patrick Arnold).\n- Transformed my blood work.\n- Realized — once again — that manic-depressive symptoms are just part of entrepreneurship.\n- Come to feel closer to all my immediate family members.\n\n### The Point\n\nMost “superheroes” are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk.\n\nPersonally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):\n\n1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.\n\n2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.\n\n3) Write down the 3-5 things — and no more — that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable.

I still have _much_ to improve, but I’m ready to share a few lessons learned. It’s my hope that they’ll save you a ton of time.\n\nI’m still flabbergasted by how this experiment took on a life of its own.  It started with [too much booze with Kevin Rose](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/), and I expected it to die a quiet death after six episodes.\n\nThat said, here are a few quick stats on _**[The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)**_ after 150 episodes of mucking about, screwing up, and refining (as of this writing):\n\n- Nearly 70,000,000 downloads as of April 2016 \\[Update: As of January 2023, more than 900M\\]\n- More than [2,500 reviews on Apple Podcasts](http://itunes.com/timferriss), [2,100+ 5-star reviews](http://itunes.com/timferriss)\n- Selected for “Best of iTunes” in 2014 and 2015\n- Out of 300,000+ podcasts on iTunes, it’s generally the #1 business podcast and an overall top-25 podcast\n- Won “Podcast of the Year” in 2015 for the Jamie Foxx episode (via [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@goldenkittymeow/collections/podcast-episodes-of-the-year))\n\nI’ve certainly stumbled a lot, but that’s how you figure things out.\n\nI’ll share the first batch of big lessons in this post. If you like it, there’s a whole lot more to divulge (e.g. exactly how I get guests, etc.). If the response is a collective “meh,” I’ll [play with my dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDZTULlH8Y6/?taken-by=timferriss) instead.\n\nI’ve formatted this little ditty as a Q&A, based on the most common questions from readers, podcasters, and journalists.\n\nHope you find it useful!\n\nThe overarching principles explored apply to a whole lot more than podcasting…\n\n###\n\n**QUESTION: Why did you start the podcast? How has it evolved over 150 episodes?**\n\nThe podcast was never intended to be a business.\n\nI was burned out after _**[The 4-Hour Chef](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20)**,_ which was nearly 700 pages, and I wanted a casual but creative break from big projects. Since I enjoyed being interviewed by **[Joe Rogan](http://podbay.fm/show/360084272/e/1359453060?autostart=1), [Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_355_-_tim_ferriss), [Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-73-tim-ferriss/)**, and other podcasting heavies who really move the needle, I decided to try long-form audio for six episodes. If I didn’t enjoy it, I would throw in the towel and walk.\n\nMy rationale: Worst-case scenario, the experience would help me improve my interviewing, which would help later book projects. This is a great example of what [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/), creator of Dilbert, would call “systems” (win even if you lose) thinking. He discusses this [at length with me here](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/22/scott-adams-the-man-behind-dilbert/).\n\nFlash forward to the current day, the podcast has found a nest in my “business,” but there is a clear hierarchy. Here are the pieces, in descending order of importance:\n\n1) **[E-mail newsletter](https://tim.blog/friday)** and **[_5-Bullet Friday_](https://tim.blog/friday)** — Unlike, say, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TimFerriss/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tferriss), I own this communication directly and it’s less subject to the whims of algorithm changes (e.g. “Oops! Now you only reach 10% of your audience.”). Some people insist that e-mail is dead for younger generations, and they’re right… until those young people get jobs. E-mail will stick around for a while, despite attempts to kill it.\n\nIt’s still the most reliable delivery mechanism, although mobile push notifications are increasingly interesting to me. Though I use **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** for internal team communication, email is still #1 for external.\n\n2) [**Blog**](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog) and **[website](http://fourhourworkweek.com/)** — Based on **[WordPress VIP](https://vip.wordpress.com/)**, ditto for the above. Even if **[Automattic](https://automattic.com/)** goes out of business (disclosure: I’m an advisor, so I think this unlikely), WordPress is open source and I’ll survive. Video and audio are fantastic, but few things travel as well as text. Unlike video and audio, I feel there is a greater appreciation of page value with solid long-form, evergreen text content. The vast majority of my most popular posts are years old (e.g. **[Hacking Kickstarter: How to Raise $100,000 in 10 Days](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/), [Scientific Speed Reading](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/0","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T17:59:23.724Z","source":"firecrawl-map"}],"totalArticles":10,"route1Count":5,"route2Count":5,"blogUrl":"https://tim.blog/","extractionMethods":{"firecrawlMap":true,"perplexityPopular":true}},"consolidation":{"newsletterContent":[{"url":"https://tim.blog/newsletter/","content":"![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Footer-CTA.jpg?resize=1024%2C476&ssl=1)\n\n## Join 1.5M+ Readers and Get Tim’s   Best Insights + Free Bonuses\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tim-ferriss-4-hour-week-books.png?resize=381%2C315&ssl=1)\n\n- **Free Chapters** of **_The 4-Hour Workweek_**,\n\n**_The 4-Hour Body_**, and **_The 4-Hour Chef_**.\n- _The 4-Hour Chef audiobook_ (~6.5 hours).\n- **5-Bullet Friday** – books, gadgets, and weekly productivity tips and tricks.\n\nEmail\n\nΔ\n\n# What Readers Are Saying\n\n![](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stars.svg)\n\n“Highly recommend the weekly newsletter ‘5-Bullet Friday’ where [@tferriss](https://x.com/tferriss) highlights the 5 coolest things he found (or explored) that week.

I’ve seen the elite implementation of all three in working with professional athletes. In this post, we’ll explore what I refer to as the “slow-carb diet”.\n\nIn the last six weeks, I have cut from about 180 lbs. to 165 lbs., while adding about 10 lbs. of muscle, which means I’ve lost about 25 lbs. of fat. This is the only diet besides the rather extreme [Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170807102316/http://www.bodybuildingdungeon.com/forums/nutrition/2156-cdk-cyclical.html) that has produced veins across my abdomen, which is the last place I lose fat (damn you, Scandinavian genetics). Here are the four simple rules I followed…\n\n**Rule #1: Avoid “white” carbohydrates**\n\nAvoid any carbohydrate that is — or can be — white. The following foods are thus prohibited, except for within 1.5 hours of finishing a resistance-training workout of at least 20 minutes in length: bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried food with breading. If you avoid eating anything white, you’ll be safe.\n\n**Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again**\n\nThe most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. Mix and match, constructing each meal with one from each of the three following groups:\n\n**Proteins:**\n\nEgg whites with one whole egg for flavor\n\nChicken breast or thigh\n\nGrass-fed organic beef\n\nPork\n\n**Legumes:**\n\nLentils\n\nBlack beans\n\nPinto beans\n\n**Vegetables:**\n\nSpinach\n\nAsparagus\n\nPeas\n\nMixed vegetables\n\nEat as much as you like of the above food items. Just remember: keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries or potatoes. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food, swapping out rice for vegetables, to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the “slow carb” diet.\n\nMost people who go on “low” carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit, not because such diets can’t work, but because they consume insufficient calories. A 1/2 cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a 1/2 cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load.\n\nSome athletes eat 6-8x per day to break up caloric load and avoid fat gain. I think this is ridiculously inconvenient. I eat 4x per day:\n\n10am – breakfast\n\n1pm – lunch\n\n5pm – smaller second lunch\n\n7:30-9pm – sports training\n\n10pm – dinner\n\n12am – glass of wine and Discovery Channel before bed\n\nHere are some of my meals that recur again and again:\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/breakfast-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nScrambled [Eggology pourable egg whites](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/eggology-organic-liquid-egg-whites-6591f9) with one whole egg, black beans, and microwaved mixed vegetables\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/lunch-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and extra guacamole (Mexican restaurant)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dinner-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef (from Trader Joe’s), lentils, and mixed vegetables\n\n**Rule #3: Don’t drink calories**\n\nDrink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened iced tea, tea, diet sodas, coffee (without white cream), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk, normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. I’m a wine fanatic and have at least one glass of wine each evening, which I believe actually aids sports recovery and fat-loss. Recent research into resveratrol supports this.\n\n**Rule #4: Take one day off per week**\n\nI recommend Saturdays as your “Dieters Gone Wild” day. I am allowed to eat whatever I want on Saturdays, and I go out of my way to eat ice cream, Snickers, Take 5, and all of my other vices in excess. I make myself a little sick and don’t want to look at any of it for the rest of the week. Paradoxically, dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function, etc.) doesn’t downregulate from extended caloric restriction. That’s right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat. Welcome to Utopia.\n\n###\n\n**If you enjoyed this post, check out my latest book, [_The 4-Hour Body_](http://amzn.to/snZqtO), #1 New York Times and #1 Amazon bestseller.** You will learn: the finer details of the Slow Carb Diet (outlined in the above post), how I gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, how to produce 15-minute female orgasms, and more.\n\n**You can also get the [Expanded and Updated 4-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357?ie=UTF8&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASI","description":"This post is one of Tim Ferriss’s most-read and referenced articles, introducing the Slow-Carb Diet and practical fat loss strategies that became foundational to his health philosophy.","topic":"Fitness & Health","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:05.574Z","source":"perplexity-popular"},{"url":"https://tim.blog/2013/05/06/how-to-cut-weight-ufc/","title":"How To Lose 20-30 Pounds In 5 Days: The Extreme Weight Cutting and Rehydration Secrets of UFC Fighters","content":"![Nate Green workout and nutrition tests collage showing feet on a scale, dietician's hand on his stomach, vertical jump test using ladder rungs, chest circumference measurement with tape.](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/measuring-main-photo.jpg?resize=500%2C361&ssl=1)\n\nThe following is a guest post by [Nate Green](https://nategreen.org/about/), who works with Dr. John Berardi, nutritional advisor to athletes like UFC champion Georges St. Pierre (GSP).\n\nThis is the first of two blog posts entailing extreme physical experiments. Absolutely no performance enhancing drugs of any kind were used.\n\n**Part 1 — this post — details exactly how top fighters like Georges St. Pierre rapidly lose 20-30 pounds for “weigh-ins.”** To refine the method, Nate performed this on himself, losing 20 pounds in 5 days. The unique part: Dr. Berardi and team measured key variables throughout the entire process, including the last “rehydration” phase. As Berardi put it:\n\n> “We used GSP’s exact protocol with him \\[Nate\\]. The idea was that by doing this with a guy who didn’t actually have to compete the next day, we could measure all sorts of performance variables that you’d never get with an athlete about to fight.”\n\n**Part 2 — [the next post](https://tim.blog/2013/05/11/how-to-gain-20-pounds-in-28-days-the-extreme-muscle-building-secrets-of-ufc-fighters/) — will share how Nate used intermittent fasting and strategically planned eating to gain 20 pounds in 28 days**, emulating a fighter who wants (or needs) to move up a weight class in competition.\n\n### Cautionary Note on Part 1\n\nMixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters put it all out in the open for the world to see: they kick, punch, laugh, cry, and bleed in front of thousands of arena fans and millions more watching at home.\n\nBut even if you’re a hardcore fan who knows all the stats, there’s something behind the scenes that you’ve probably never seen in full: **world-class weight manipulation**…\n\nDone right, it can significantly increase a fighter’s chances of winning. An athlete will artificially lower his weight for pre-fight weigh-ins, then show up to the actual fight 10, 20, or even 30 pounds heavier than his opponent. It’s a game changer.\n\nDone wrong, it can make even the toughest guy lose his edge… and probably the fight. There’s serious risk of organ failure if done haphazardly.\n\nEven though boxers and wrestlers have been manipulating weight in this fashion for decades, it has the air of illicit activity. **And though it’s legal in MMA competition, you should _never_ try this at home or without medical supervision. Excessive dehydration can kill you. “Cutting weight” has no place in real-world dieting or behavior.**\n\nThis is NOT an article on sustainable weight loss or healthy living. Rather, it’s a fascinating look at how far athletes and scientists will go to manipulate the human body for competitive advantage.\n\nHere’s how it works…\n\n### Enter Nate\n\nImagine this: It’s Saturday night and you’re a top-ranked MMA fighter who just stepped into the cage to fight for the 170-pound Welterweight Championship.\n\n**Question:** How much do you weigh?\n\nThe answer may seem obvious: 170 pounds, right? But if you followed the steps of extreme weight manipulation, the real answer is that you weigh somewhere between 185 and 190 pounds. That’s 15-20 pounds _more_ than the “cutoff” weight of 170.\n\n24 hours _before_ you stepped into the cage, however, you did in fact weigh 170 pounds. You had to. Friday night was the official weigh-in where you and your opponent both stripped down to your skivvies, stepped on the scale in front of the judge, and prayed that the number on the scale hit 170 or lower.\n\nBut once you stepped off that scale it was a race to gain weight.\n\nI find this kind of physiological puppetry very interesting. Most of us regular guys have a hard time gaining or losing just 5 pounds at a time.\n\nBut the top combat athletes can lose up to 30 pounds in just _5 days_ leading up to the fight. Then they can gain nearly all of it back in the 24 hours between weighing in and going toe-to-toe.\n\nThey do this to gain a massive competitive advantage. In other words, the bigger guy who retains more of his strength, agility, and endurance will likely win. The guy who weighs in at 170 — and then _fights_ at 170 — often has a world of hurt coming his way.\n\nThat’s why Anderson Silva – arguably the world’s best MMA fighter — normally fights in the 185-pound class even though he actually weighs 215 pounds. A few days before he fights, Anderson “cuts” 30 pounds to make weight…then gains most of his weight back in 24 hours in time for his fight.\n\nGeorges St Pierre — arguably the world’s 2nd best fighter – normally walks around at 195 pounds.

In fact, while on an airplane in China two weeks ago, I helped [Glenn McElhose](http://www.dirtsalad.com/) increase his reading speed 34% in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI have never seen the method fail. Here’s how it works…\n\n### The PX Project\n\nThe PX Project, a single 3-hour cognitive experiment, produced an average increase in reading speed of 386%.\n\nIt was tested with speakers of five languages, and even dyslexics were conditioned to read technical material at more than 3,000 words-per-minute (wpm), or 10 pages per minute. One page every 6 seconds. By comparison, the average reading speed in the US is 200-300 wpm (1/2 to 1 page per minute), with the top 1% of the population reading over 400 wpm…\n\nIf you understand several basic principles of the human visual system, you can eliminate inefficiencies and increase speed while improving retention.\n\nTo perform the exercises in this post and see the results, you will need: a book of 200+ pages that can lie flat when open, a pen, and a timer (a stop watch with alarm or kitchen timer is ideal). You should complete the 20 minutes of exercises in one session.\n\n**First, several definitions and distinctions specific to the reading process:**\n\n**A) Synopsis:** **You must minimize the number and duration of fixations per line to increase speed.**\n\nYou do not read in a straight line, but rather in a sequence of saccadic movements (jumps). Each of these saccades ends with a fixation, or a temporary snapshot of the text within you focus area (approx. the size of a quarter at 8 inches from reading surface). Each fixation will last ¼ to ½ seconds in the untrained subject. To demonstrate this, close one eye, place a fingertip on top of that eyelid, and then slowly scan a straight horizontal line with your other eye-you will feel distinct and separate movements and periods of fixation.\n\n**B) Synopsis:** **You must eliminate regression and back-skipping to increase speed.**\n\nThe untrained subject engages in regression (conscious rereading) and back-skipping (subconscious rereading via misplacement of fixation) for up to 30% of total reading time.\n\n**C) Synopsis:** **You must use conditioning drills to increase horizontal peripheral vision span and the number of words registered per fixation.**\n\nUntrained subjects use central focus but not horizontal peripheral vision span during reading, foregoing up to 50% of their words per fixation (the number of words that can be perceived and “read” in each fixation).\n\n### The Protocol\n\nYou will 1) learn technique, 2) learn to apply techniques with speed through conditioning, then 3) learn to test yourself with reading for comprehension.\n\nThese are separate, and your adaptation to the sequencing depends on keeping them separate. Do not worry about comprehension if you are learning to apply a motor skill with speed, for example. The adaptive sequence is: technique ‘ technique with speed ‘ comprehensive reading testing.\n\nAs a general rule, you will need to practice technique at 3x the speed of your ultimate target reading speed. Thus, if you currently read at 300 wpm and your target reading speed is 900 wpm, you will need to practice technique at 2,700 words-per-minute, or 6 pages per minute (10 seconds per page).\n\nWe will cover two main techniques in this introduction:\n\n1) Trackers and Pacers (to address A and B above)\n\n2) Perceptual Expansion (to address C)\n\n### First – Determining Baseline\n\nTo determine your current reading speed, take your practice book (which should lay flat when open on a table) and count the number of words in 5 lines. Divide this number of words by 5, and you have your average number of words-per-line.\n\nExample: 62 words/5 lines = 12.4, which you round to 12 words-per-line\n\nNext, count the number of text lines on 5 pages and divide by 5 to arrive at the average number of lines per page. Multiply this by average number of words-per-line, and you have your average number of words per page.\n\nExample: 154 lines/5 pages = 30.8, rounded to 31 lines per page x 12 words-per-line = 372 words per page\n\nMark your first line and read with a timer for 1 minute exactly-do not read faster than normal, and read for comprehension. After exactly one minute, multiply the number of lines by your average words-per-line to determine your current words-per-minute (wpm) rate.\n\n### Second – Trackers and Pacers\n\nRegression, back-skipping, and the duration of fixations can be minimized by using a tracker and pacer. To illustrate the importance of a tracker-did you use a pen or finger when counting t","description":"This post distills Ferriss’s accelerated learning principles, providing practical speed reading techniques that have been adopted by thousands seeking to learn more efficiently.","topic":"Productivity & Learning","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:33.635Z","source":"perplexity-popular"},{"url":"https://tim.blog/2007/04/27/from-geek-to-freak-how-i-gained-34-lbs-of-muscle-in-4-weeks/","title":"From Geek to Freak: How I Gained 34 lbs. of Muscle in 4 Weeks","content":"Manage Cookie Consent\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

This quote convinced me to put on my big girl pants:\n\n> “The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right.”\n>\n> – Neil Gaiman\n>\n> [University of the Arts Commencement Speech](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/05/22/neil-gaiman-commencement-speech/)\n\nSo, here goes, and I hope it helps at least a few of you.\n\n### Reality Check\n\nA few months ago, I had a birthday party.\n\nA dozen friends and I gathered for several days of wonderful sun, beach, and catching up. On the last day, I didn’t get up until 11:30am, knowing full well that the last remaining friends were leaving at 12 noon.\n\nI was afraid of being alone.\n\nLike a child, I hid my head under the covers (literally) and hit snooze until reality couldn’t be postponed any further.\n\nBut…why am I telling you this?…\n\n### The Dangerous Myths of “Successful” People\n\nWe all like to appear “successful” (a nebulous term at best) and the media like to portray standouts as superheroes.\n\nSometimes, these dramatic stories of overcoming the odds are inspiring. More often, they lead to an unhealthy knee-jerk conclusion:\n\n**“Well… maybe _they_ \\[entrepreneur/artist/creator painted as superhero\\] can do it, but I’m just a normal guy/girl…”**\n\nThis post is intended to give a behind-the-scenes look at my own life. Though I’ve occasionally done profiles like [A Day In The Life](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/04/24/tim-ferriss-a-day-in-the-life/) with Morgan Spurlock’s crew, I rarely let journalists follow me for a “normal” day. Why?\n\nI’m no superhero. I’m not even a consistent “normal.”\n\n**In the last 3 months, I’ve:**\n\n- Cried while watching [Rudy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W221/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004W221&linkCode=as2&tag=offsitoftimfe-20).\n- Repeatedly hit Snooze for 1-3 HOURS past my planned wake time, because I simply didn’t want to face the day.\n- Considered giving everything away and moving to Montreal, Seville, or Iceland. Location varies based on what I’m escaping.\n- Seen a therapist for the first time, as I was convinced that I was doomed to life-long pessimism.\n- Used gentlemanly (ahem) websites to “relax” during the day when I clearly have urgent and important shit to do. [1](https://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/#fn-10297-1)\n- Taken my daily caffeine intake (read: self-medication) so high that my “resting” pulse was 120+ beats per minute. 8-10 cups of coffee per day minimum.\n- Worn the same pair of jeans for a week straight just to have a much-needed constant during weeks of chaos.\n\nSeems pretty dysfunctional, right?\n\n**But, in the last 8 weeks, I’ve also:**\n\n- Increased my passive income 20%+.\n- Bought my dream house.\n- Meditated twice per day for 20 minutes per session, without fail. This marks the first time I’ve been able to meditate consistently.\n- I’ve cut my caffeine intake to next-to-nothing (in the last 4 weeks): usually pu-erh tea in the morning and green tea in the afternoon. I’ve had no more than 1 cup of coffee per week. More on this in a later post.\n- With your help, [raised $100,000+ for charity:water](http://my.charitywater.org/timferriss) for my birthday. (Thanks to John Park for bringing the thunder!)\n- [Raised $250,000 in 53 minutes for a start-up called Shyp](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/09/23/youd-like-to-be-an-angel-investor-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-my-deals/).\n- Signed [one of the most exciting business deals of my last 10 years](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/10/13/the-tim-ferriss-experiment/).\n- Added roughy 20 pounds of muscle after learning the pain and joy of high-rep front squats (and topical DHEA, courtesy of Patrick Arnold).\n- Transformed my blood work.\n- Realized — once again — that manic-depressive symptoms are just part of entrepreneurship.\n- Come to feel closer to all my immediate family members.\n\n### The Point\n\nMost “superheroes” are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk.\n\nPersonally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):\n\n1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.\n\n2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.\n\n3) Write down the 3-5 things — and no more — that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable.

I still have _much_ to improve, but I’m ready to share a few lessons learned. It’s my hope that they’ll save you a ton of time.\n\nI’m still flabbergasted by how this experiment took on a life of its own.  It started with [too much booze with Kevin Rose](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/), and I expected it to die a quiet death after six episodes.\n\nThat said, here are a few quick stats on _**[The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)**_ after 150 episodes of mucking about, screwing up, and refining (as of this writing):\n\n- Nearly 70,000,000 downloads as of April 2016 \\[Update: As of January 2023, more than 900M\\]\n- More than [2,500 reviews on Apple Podcasts](http://itunes.com/timferriss), [2,100+ 5-star reviews](http://itunes.com/timferriss)\n- Selected for “Best of iTunes” in 2014 and 2015\n- Out of 300,000+ podcasts on iTunes, it’s generally the #1 business podcast and an overall top-25 podcast\n- Won “Podcast of the Year” in 2015 for the Jamie Foxx episode (via [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@goldenkittymeow/collections/podcast-episodes-of-the-year))\n\nI’ve certainly stumbled a lot, but that’s how you figure things out.\n\nI’ll share the first batch of big lessons in this post. If you like it, there’s a whole lot more to divulge (e.g. exactly how I get guests, etc.). If the response is a collective “meh,” I’ll [play with my dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDZTULlH8Y6/?taken-by=timferriss) instead.\n\nI’ve formatted this little ditty as a Q&A, based on the most common questions from readers, podcasters, and journalists.\n\nHope you find it useful!\n\nThe overarching principles explored apply to a whole lot more than podcasting…\n\n###\n\n**QUESTION: Why did you start the podcast? How has it evolved over 150 episodes?**\n\nThe podcast was never intended to be a business.\n\nI was burned out after _**[The 4-Hour Chef](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20)**,_ which was nearly 700 pages, and I wanted a casual but creative break from big projects. Since I enjoyed being interviewed by **[Joe Rogan](http://podbay.fm/show/360084272/e/1359453060?autostart=1), [Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_355_-_tim_ferriss), [Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-73-tim-ferriss/)**, and other podcasting heavies who really move the needle, I decided to try long-form audio for six episodes. If I didn’t enjoy it, I would throw in the towel and walk.\n\nMy rationale: Worst-case scenario, the experience would help me improve my interviewing, which would help later book projects. This is a great example of what [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/), creator of Dilbert, would call “systems” (win even if you lose) thinking. He discusses this [at length with me here](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/22/scott-adams-the-man-behind-dilbert/).\n\nFlash forward to the current day, the podcast has found a nest in my “business,” but there is a clear hierarchy. Here are the pieces, in descending order of importance:\n\n1) **[E-mail newsletter](https://tim.blog/friday)** and **[_5-Bullet Friday_](https://tim.blog/friday)** — Unlike, say, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TimFerriss/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tferriss), I own this communication directly and it’s less subject to the whims of algorithm changes (e.g. “Oops! Now you only reach 10% of your audience.”). Some people insist that e-mail is dead for younger generations, and they’re right… until those young people get jobs. E-mail will stick around for a while, despite attempts to kill it.\n\nIt’s still the most reliable delivery mechanism, although mobile push notifications are increasingly interesting to me. Though I use **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** for internal team communication, email is still #1 for external.\n\n2) [**Blog**](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog) and **[website](http://fourhourworkweek.com/)** — Based on **[WordPress VIP](https://vip.wordpress.com/)**, ditto for the above. Even if **[Automattic](https://automattic.com/)** goes out of business (disclosure: I’m an advisor, so I think this unlikely), WordPress is open source and I’ll survive. Video and audio are fantastic, but few things travel as well as text. Unlike video and audio, I feel there is a greater appreciation of page value with solid long-form, evergreen text content. The vast majority of my most popular posts are years old (e.g. **[Hacking Kickstarter: How to Raise $100,000 in 10 Days](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/), [Scientific Speed Reading](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/0","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T17:59:23.724Z","source":"firecrawl-map"}],"allContent":[{"type":"newsletter","content":"![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Footer-CTA.jpg?resize=1024%2C476&ssl=1)\n\n## Join 1.5M+ Readers and Get Tim’s   Best Insights + Free Bonuses\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tim-ferriss-4-hour-week-books.png?resize=381%2C315&ssl=1)\n\n- **Free Chapters** of **_The 4-Hour Workweek_**,\n\n**_The 4-Hour Body_**, and **_The 4-Hour Chef_**.\n- _The 4-Hour Chef audiobook_ (~6.5 hours).\n- **5-Bullet Friday** – books, gadgets, and weekly productivity tips and tricks.\n\nEmail\n\nΔ\n\n# What Readers Are Saying\n\n![](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stars.svg)\n\n“Highly recommend the weekly newsletter ‘5-Bullet Friday’ where [@tferriss](https://x.com/tferriss) highlights the 5 coolest things he found (or explored) that week.

I’ve seen the elite implementation of all three in working with professional athletes. In this post, we’ll explore what I refer to as the “slow-carb diet”.\n\nIn the last six weeks, I have cut from about 180 lbs. to 165 lbs., while adding about 10 lbs. of muscle, which means I’ve lost about 25 lbs. of fat. This is the only diet besides the rather extreme [Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170807102316/http://www.bodybuildingdungeon.com/forums/nutrition/2156-cdk-cyclical.html) that has produced veins across my abdomen, which is the last place I lose fat (damn you, Scandinavian genetics). Here are the four simple rules I followed…\n\n**Rule #1: Avoid “white” carbohydrates**\n\nAvoid any carbohydrate that is — or can be — white. The following foods are thus prohibited, except for within 1.5 hours of finishing a resistance-training workout of at least 20 minutes in length: bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried food with breading. If you avoid eating anything white, you’ll be safe.\n\n**Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again**\n\nThe most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. Mix and match, constructing each meal with one from each of the three following groups:\n\n**Proteins:**\n\nEgg whites with one whole egg for flavor\n\nChicken breast or thigh\n\nGrass-fed organic beef\n\nPork\n\n**Legumes:**\n\nLentils\n\nBlack beans\n\nPinto beans\n\n**Vegetables:**\n\nSpinach\n\nAsparagus\n\nPeas\n\nMixed vegetables\n\nEat as much as you like of the above food items. Just remember: keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries or potatoes. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food, swapping out rice for vegetables, to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the “slow carb” diet.\n\nMost people who go on “low” carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit, not because such diets can’t work, but because they consume insufficient calories. A 1/2 cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a 1/2 cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load.\n\nSome athletes eat 6-8x per day to break up caloric load and avoid fat gain. I think this is ridiculously inconvenient. I eat 4x per day:\n\n10am – breakfast\n\n1pm – lunch\n\n5pm – smaller second lunch\n\n7:30-9pm – sports training\n\n10pm – dinner\n\n12am – glass of wine and Discovery Channel before bed\n\nHere are some of my meals that recur again and again:\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/breakfast-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nScrambled [Eggology pourable egg whites](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/eggology-organic-liquid-egg-whites-6591f9) with one whole egg, black beans, and microwaved mixed vegetables\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/lunch-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and extra guacamole (Mexican restaurant)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dinner-wince.jpg?resize=240%2C180&ssl=1)\n\nGrass-fed organic beef (from Trader Joe’s), lentils, and mixed vegetables\n\n**Rule #3: Don’t drink calories**\n\nDrink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened iced tea, tea, diet sodas, coffee (without white cream), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk, normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. I’m a wine fanatic and have at least one glass of wine each evening, which I believe actually aids sports recovery and fat-loss. Recent research into resveratrol supports this.\n\n**Rule #4: Take one day off per week**\n\nI recommend Saturdays as your “Dieters Gone Wild” day. I am allowed to eat whatever I want on Saturdays, and I go out of my way to eat ice cream, Snickers, Take 5, and all of my other vices in excess. I make myself a little sick and don’t want to look at any of it for the rest of the week.

Absolutely no performance enhancing drugs of any kind were used.\n\n**Part 1 — this post — details exactly how top fighters like Georges St. Pierre rapidly lose 20-30 pounds for “weigh-ins.”** To refine the method, Nate performed this on himself, losing 20 pounds in 5 days. The unique part: Dr. Berardi and team measured key variables throughout the entire process, including the last “rehydration” phase. As Berardi put it:\n\n> “We used GSP’s exact protocol with him \\[Nate\\]. The idea was that by doing this with a guy who didn’t actually have to compete the next day, we could measure all sorts of performance variables that you’d never get with an athlete about to fight.”\n\n**Part 2 — [the next post](https://tim.blog/2013/05/11/how-to-gain-20-pounds-in-28-days-the-extreme-muscle-building-secrets-of-ufc-fighters/) — will share how Nate used intermittent fasting and strategically planned eating to gain 20 pounds in 28 days**, emulating a fighter who wants (or needs) to move up a weight class in competition.\n\n### Cautionary Note on Part 1\n\nMixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters put it all out in the open for the world to see: they kick, punch, laugh, cry, and bleed in front of thousands of arena fans and millions more watching at home.\n\nBut even if you’re a hardcore fan who knows all the stats, there’s something behind the scenes that you’ve probably never seen in full: **world-class weight manipulation**…\n\nDone right, it can significantly increase a fighter’s chances of winning. An athlete will artificially lower his weight for pre-fight weigh-ins, then show up to the actual fight 10, 20, or even 30 pounds heavier than his opponent. It’s a game changer.\n\nDone wrong, it can make even the toughest guy lose his edge… and probably the fight. There’s serious risk of organ failure if done haphazardly.\n\nEven though boxers and wrestlers have been manipulating weight in this fashion for decades, it has the air of illicit activity. **And though it’s legal in MMA competition, you should _never_ try this at home or without medical supervision. Excessive dehydration can kill you. “Cutting weight” has no place in real-world dieting or behavior.**\n\nThis is NOT an article on sustainable weight loss or healthy living. Rather, it’s a fascinating look at how far athletes and scientists will go to manipulate the human body for competitive advantage.\n\nHere’s how it works…\n\n### Enter Nate\n\nImagine this: It’s Saturday night and you’re a top-ranked MMA fighter who just stepped into the cage to fight for the 170-pound Welterweight Championship.\n\n**Question:** How much do you weigh?\n\nThe answer may seem obvious: 170 pounds, right? But if you followed the steps of extreme weight manipulation, the real answer is that you weigh somewhere between 185 and 190 pounds. That’s 15-20 pounds _more_ than the “cutoff” weight of 170.\n\n24 hours _before_ you stepped into the cage, however, you did in fact weigh 170 pounds. You had to. Friday night was the official weigh-in where you and your opponent both stripped down to your skivvies, stepped on the scale in front of the judge, and prayed that the number on the scale hit 170 or lower.\n\nBut once you stepped off that scale it was a race to gain weight.\n\nI find this kind of physiological puppetry very interesting. Most of us regular guys have a hard time gaining or losing just 5 pounds at a time.\n\nBut the top combat athletes can lose up to 30 pounds in just _5 days_ leading up to the fight. Then they can gain nearly all of it back in the 24 hours between weighing in and going toe-to-toe.\n\nThey do this to gain a massive competitive advantage. In other words, the bigger guy who retains more of his strength, agility, and endurance will likely win. The guy who weighs in at 170 — and then _fights_ at 170 — often has a world of hurt coming his way.\n\nThat’s why Anderson Silva – arguably the world’s best MMA fighter — normally fights in the 185-pound class even though he actually weighs 215 pounds. A few days before he fights, Anderson “cuts” 30 pounds to make weight…then gains most of his weight back in 24 hours in time for his fight.\n\nGeorges St Pierre — arguably the world’s 2nd best fighter – normally walks around at 195 pounds. He ends up cutting 25 pounds to make his 170 pound weight class, and then gains 20 of it back before his fight.\n\nSneaky, huh?\n\nJust how do these guys do it? And what does this rapid weight loss and weight gain do to their performance?\n\n### My Ext","metadata":{"title":"How To Lose 20-30 Pounds In 5 Days: The Extreme Weight Cutting and Rehydration Secrets of UFC Fighters","url":"https://tim.blog/2013/05/06/how-to-cut-weight-ufc/","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:22.819Z"}},{"type":"blog","content":"How much more could you get done if you completed all of your required reading in 1/3 or 1/5 the time?\n\nIncreasing reading speed is a process of controlling fine motor movement—period.\n\nThis post is a condensed overview of principles I taught to undergraduates at Princeton University in 1998 at a seminar called the “PX Project.” The below was written several years ago, so it’s worded like Ivy Leaguer pompous-ass prose, but the results are substantial. In fact, while on an airplane in China two weeks ago, I helped [Glenn McElhose](http://www.dirtsalad.com/) increase his reading speed 34% in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI have never seen the method fail. Here’s how it works…\n\n### The PX Project\n\nThe PX Project, a single 3-hour cognitive experiment, produced an average increase in reading speed of 386%.\n\nIt was tested with speakers of five languages, and even dyslexics were conditioned to read technical material at more than 3,000 words-per-minute (wpm), or 10 pages per minute. One page every 6 seconds. By comparison, the average reading speed in the US is 200-300 wpm (1/2 to 1 page per minute), with the top 1% of the population reading over 400 wpm…\n\nIf you understand several basic principles of the human visual system, you can eliminate inefficiencies and increase speed while improving retention.\n\nTo perform the exercises in this post and see the results, you will need: a book of 200+ pages that can lie flat when open, a pen, and a timer (a stop watch with alarm or kitchen timer is ideal). You should complete the 20 minutes of exercises in one session.\n\n**First, several definitions and distinctions specific to the reading process:**\n\n**A) Synopsis:** **You must minimize the number and duration of fixations per line to increase speed.**\n\nYou do not read in a straight line, but rather in a sequence of saccadic movements (jumps). Each of these saccades ends with a fixation, or a temporary snapshot of the text within you focus area (approx. the size of a quarter at 8 inches from reading surface). Each fixation will last ¼ to ½ seconds in the untrained subject. To demonstrate this, close one eye, place a fingertip on top of that eyelid, and then slowly scan a straight horizontal line with your other eye-you will feel distinct and separate movements and periods of fixation.\n\n**B) Synopsis:** **You must eliminate regression and back-skipping to increase speed.**\n\nThe untrained subject engages in regression (conscious rereading) and back-skipping (subconscious rereading via misplacement of fixation) for up to 30% of total reading time.\n\n**C) Synopsis:** **You must use conditioning drills to increase horizontal peripheral vision span and the number of words registered per fixation.**\n\nUntrained subjects use central focus but not horizontal peripheral vision span during reading, foregoing up to 50% of their words per fixation (the number of words that can be perceived and “read” in each fixation).\n\n### The Protocol\n\nYou will 1) learn technique, 2) learn to apply techniques with speed through conditioning, then 3) learn to test yourself with reading for comprehension.\n\nThese are separate, and your adaptation to the sequencing depends on keeping them separate. Do not worry about comprehension if you are learning to apply a motor skill with speed, for example. The adaptive sequence is: technique ‘ technique with speed ‘ comprehensive reading testing.\n\nAs a general rule, you will need to practice technique at 3x the speed of your ultimate target reading speed. Thus, if you currently read at 300 wpm and your target reading speed is 900 wpm, you will need to practice technique at 2,700 words-per-minute, or 6 pages per minute (10 seconds per page).\n\nWe will cover two main techniques in this introduction:\n\n1) Trackers and Pacers (to address A and B above)\n\n2) Perceptual Expansion (to address C)\n\n### First – Determining Baseline\n\nTo determine your current reading speed, take your practice book (which should lay flat when open on a table) and count the number of words in 5 lines. Divide this number of words by 5, and you have your average number of words-per-line.\n\nExample: 62 words/5 lines = 12.4, which you round to 12 words-per-line\n\nNext, count the number of text lines on 5 pages and divide by 5 to arrive at the average number of lines per page. Multiply this by average number of words-per-line, and you have your average number of words per page.\n\nExample: 154 lines/5 pages = 30.8, rounded to 31 lines per page x 12 words-per-line = 372 words per page\n\nMark your first line and read with a timer for 1 minute exactly-do not read faster than normal, and read for comprehension. After exactly one minute, multiply the number of lines by your average words-per-line to determine your current words-per-minute (wpm) rate.\n\n### Second – Trackers and Pacers\n\nRegression, back-skipping, and the duration of fixations can be minimized by using a tracker and pacer. To illustrate the importance of a tracker-did you use a pen or finger when counting t","metadata":{"title":"Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes","url":"https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T18:00:33.635Z"}},{"type":"blog","content":"Manage Cookie Consent\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

This quote convinced me to put on my big girl pants:\n\n> “The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right.”\n>\n> – Neil Gaiman\n>\n> [University of the Arts Commencement Speech](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/05/22/neil-gaiman-commencement-speech/)\n\nSo, here goes, and I hope it helps at least a few of you.\n\n### Reality Check\n\nA few months ago, I had a birthday party.\n\nA dozen friends and I gathered for several days of wonderful sun, beach, and catching up. On the last day, I didn’t get up until 11:30am, knowing full well that the last remaining friends were leaving at 12 noon.\n\nI was afraid of being alone.\n\nLike a child, I hid my head under the covers (literally) and hit snooze until reality couldn’t be postponed any further.\n\nBut…why am I telling you this?…\n\n### The Dangerous Myths of “Successful” People\n\nWe all like to appear “successful” (a nebulous term at best) and the media like to portray standouts as superheroes.\n\nSometimes, these dramatic stories of overcoming the odds are inspiring. More often, they lead to an unhealthy knee-jerk conclusion:\n\n**“Well… maybe _they_ \\[entrepreneur/artist/creator painted as superhero\\] can do it, but I’m just a normal guy/girl…”**\n\nThis post is intended to give a behind-the-scenes look at my own life. Though I’ve occasionally done profiles like [A Day In The Life](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/04/24/tim-ferriss-a-day-in-the-life/) with Morgan Spurlock’s crew, I rarely let journalists follow me for a “normal” day. Why?\n\nI’m no superhero. I’m not even a consistent “normal.”\n\n**In the last 3 months, I’ve:**\n\n- Cried while watching [Rudy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W221/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004W221&linkCode=as2&tag=offsitoftimfe-20).\n- Repeatedly hit Snooze for 1-3 HOURS past my planned wake time, because I simply didn’t want to face the day.\n- Considered giving everything away and moving to Montreal, Seville, or Iceland. Location varies based on what I’m escaping.\n- Seen a therapist for the first time, as I was convinced that I was doomed to life-long pessimism.\n- Used gentlemanly (ahem) websites to “relax” during the day when I clearly have urgent and important shit to do. [1](https://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/#fn-10297-1)\n- Taken my daily caffeine intake (read: self-medication) so high that my “resting” pulse was 120+ beats per minute. 8-10 cups of coffee per day minimum.\n- Worn the same pair of jeans for a week straight just to have a much-needed constant during weeks of chaos.\n\nSeems pretty dysfunctional, right?\n\n**But, in the last 8 weeks, I’ve also:**\n\n- Increased my passive income 20%+.\n- Bought my dream house.\n- Meditated twice per day for 20 minutes per session, without fail. This marks the first time I’ve been able to meditate consistently.\n- I’ve cut my caffeine intake to next-to-nothing (in the last 4 weeks): usually pu-erh tea in the morning and green tea in the afternoon. I’ve had no more than 1 cup of coffee per week. More on this in a later post.\n- With your help, [raised $100,000+ for charity:water](http://my.charitywater.org/timferriss) for my birthday. (Thanks to John Park for bringing the thunder!)\n- [Raised $250,000 in 53 minutes for a start-up called Shyp](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/09/23/youd-like-to-be-an-angel-investor-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-my-deals/).\n- Signed [one of the most exciting business deals of my last 10 years](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2013/10/13/the-tim-ferriss-experiment/).\n- Added roughy 20 pounds of muscle after learning the pain and joy of high-rep front squats (and topical DHEA, courtesy of Patrick Arnold).\n- Transformed my blood work.\n- Realized — once again — that manic-depressive symptoms are just part of entrepreneurship.\n- Come to feel closer to all my immediate family members.\n\n### The Point\n\nMost “superheroes” are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk.\n\nPersonally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):\n\n1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.\n\n2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.\n\n3) Write down the 3-5 things — and no more — that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted fro","metadata":{"title":"Untitled","url":"https://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks","extractedAt":"2025-08-14T17:59:14.975Z"}},{"type":"blog","content":"Please enjoy this transcript of [my interview with Jimmy Wales](https://tim.blog/2021/08/24/jimmy-wales/) ( [@jimmy\\_wales](https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales)), founder of the online nonprofit encyclopedia [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and cofounder of the privately owned Wikia, Inc., including its entertainment media brand [Fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)), powered by Wikia.

I still have _much_ to improve, but I’m ready to share a few lessons learned. It’s my hope that they’ll save you a ton of time.\n\nI’m still flabbergasted by how this experiment took on a life of its own.  It started with [too much booze with Kevin Rose](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/), and I expected it to die a quiet death after six episodes.\n\nThat said, here are a few quick stats on _**[The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)**_ after 150 episodes of mucking about, screwing up, and refining (as of this writing):\n\n- Nearly 70,000,000 downloads as of April 2016 \\[Update: As of January 2023, more than 900M\\]\n- More than [2,500 reviews on Apple Podcasts](http://itunes.com/timferriss), [2,100+ 5-star reviews](http://itunes.com/timferriss)\n- Selected for “Best of iTunes” in 2014 and 2015\n- Out of 300,000+ podcasts on iTunes, it’s generally the #1 business podcast and an overall top-25 podcast\n- Won “Podcast of the Year” in 2015 for the Jamie Foxx episode (via [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@goldenkittymeow/collections/podcast-episodes-of-the-year))\n\nI’ve certainly stumbled a lot, but that’s how you figure things out.\n\nI’ll share the first batch of big lessons in this post. If you like it, there’s a whole lot more to divulge (e.g. exactly how I get guests, etc.). If the response is a collective “meh,” I’ll [play with my dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDZTULlH8Y6/?taken-by=timferriss) instead.\n\nI’ve formatted this little ditty as a Q&A, based on the most common questions from readers, podcasters, and journalists.\n\nHope you find it useful!\n\nThe overarching principles explored apply to a whole lot more than podcasting…\n\n###\n\n**QUESTION: Why did you start the podcast? How has it evolved over 150 episodes?**\n\nThe podcast was never intended to be a business.\n\nI was burned out after _**[The 4-Hour Chef](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20)**,_ which was nearly 700 pages, and I wanted a casual but creative break from big projects. Since I enjoyed being interviewed by **[Joe Rogan](http://podbay.fm/show/360084272/e/1359453060?autostart=1), [Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_355_-_tim_ferriss), [Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-73-tim-ferriss/)**, and other podcasting heavies who really move the needle, I decided to try long-form audio for six episodes. If I didn’t enjoy it, I would throw in the towel and walk.\n\nMy rationale: Worst-case scenario, the experience would help me improve my interviewing, which would help later book projects. This is a great example of what [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/), creator of Dilbert, would call “systems” (win even if you lose) thinking. He discusses this [at length with me here](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/22/scott-adams-the-man-behind-dilbert/).\n\nFlash forward to the current day, the podcast has found a nest in my “business,” but there is a clear hierarchy. Here are the pieces, in descending order of importance:\n\n1) **[E-mail newsletter](https://tim.blog/friday)** and **[_5-Bullet Friday_](https://tim.blog/friday)** — Unlike, say, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TimFerriss/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tferriss), I own this communication directly and it’s less subject to the whims of algorithm changes (e.g. “Oops! Now you only reach 10% of your audience.”). Some people insist that e-mail is dead for younger generations, and they’re right… until those young people get jobs. E-mail will stick around for a while, despite attempts to kill it.\n\nIt’s still the most reliable delivery mechanism, although mobile push notifications are increasingly interesting to me. Though I use **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** for internal team communication, email is still #1 for external.\n\n2) [**Blog**](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog) and **[website](http://fourhourworkweek.com/)** — Based on **[WordPress VIP](https://vip.wordpress.com/)**, ditto for the above. Even if **[Automattic](https://automattic.com/)** goes out of business (disclosure: I’m an advisor, so I think this unlikely), WordPress is open source and I’ll survive. Video and audio are fantastic, but few things travel as well as text. Unlike video and audio, I feel there is a greater appreciation of page value with solid long-form, evergreen text content.
